## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

How to remove the gap between two inline-block divs:

```html
  <div class="skills">
    <div class="graphic-design">
      <h2>Graphic design</h2>
      <p>
        Great design makes you memorable. We deliver artwork that
        underscores your brand message and captures potential clientsâ€™
        attention.
      </p>
    </div><!--
    --><div class="photography">
      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p>
        Increase your credibility by getting the most stunning, high-quality
        photos that improve your business image.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
```
